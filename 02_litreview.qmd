Effectiveness of Temporary Portable Rumble Strips (TPRS)

Non-adhesive TPRS, typically made of steel and rubber, have been used since 2009 to improve work zone safety [@meyer_design_2006, @pss_best_2018]. Research consistently shows that TPRS can reduce traffic speed, increase driver attentiveness, and minimize erratic driving behaviors such as lane departures [@brown_effectiveness_2022, @sun_elevated-risk_2011, @wang_effects_2013, @yang_effectiveness_2015].

## Speed Reduction

TPRS installations are effective at reducing vehicle speeds in work zones. Studies report speed reductions ranging from 3.5 to 13.8 mph, with greater reductions observed near the first set of strips and when drivers can see a flagger or additional barriers [@brown_effectiveness_2022; @sun_elevated-risk_2011; @wang_effects_2013; @yang_effectiveness_2015]. The effect is highly localized, and speeds tend to increase once drivers pass the TPRS unless additional measures are present.

## Driver Attentiveness

TPRS increase driver attentiveness, often measured by the frequency of brake light activation as vehicles approach the strips. Studies show that TPRS prompt more drivers to brake and pay attention to changing road conditions, though the percentage varies by site and conditions [@brown_effectiveness_2022; @sun_elevated-risk_2011; @wang_effects_2013; @yang_effectiveness_2015]. Commercial vehicles tend to respond more cautiously than passenger cars.

## Erratic Driving (Lane Departures)

Concerns about drivers evading TPRS by leaving their lane have been largely unfounded. Most studies report minimal lane departures, especially when TPRS are installed across the full width of the road [@sun_elevated-risk_2011; @wang_effects_2013; @brown_effectiveness_2022]. Lane departures are more likely on narrow roads or near the end of a TPRS array, but overall rates are low.

## Displacement of TPRS

A key challenge with non-adhesive TPRS is their tendency to shift or become displaced under traffic. Displacement increases with heavier vehicles, higher speeds, and repeated passes [@heaslip_closed-course_2010, @schrock_development_2016, @sun_elevated-risk_2011]. Placement angle also mattersâ€”strips that rotate away from perpendicular to traffic tend to move more. Real-world studies show that while displacement is generally manageable, it can require periodic adjustment, which may increase worker exposure to traffic. The effect of strip wear and long-term durability under heavy use is not well understood and requires further research.

## Summary

TPRS are effective at reducing speeds, increasing driver attentiveness, and minimizing erratic driving in work zones. Displacement under traffic remains a practical concern, especially for non-adhesive products, and more research is needed on long-term performance and optimal deployment strategies.

## Citations and Bibliographies

<!-- Quarto has a robust method for generating citations. 
If you follow the [setup instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#citations-from-zotero), 
then you can easily search your database from inside Rstudio after typing the `@` command. 
Keep your Zotero database up-to-date and correct (and share it with your coauthors!) to minimize the pain you will feel in writing articles.

Note that there are two ways to make citations. 
Doing `@key` will give you a text citation, allowing you to refer to the author mid-sentence.

> @ben-akivaDiscreteChoiceAnalysis1985 is the canonical reference in choice modeling for transportation.

But if you put the citation in brackets like `[@citationkey]` you can make parenthetical citations. 
You can also give page numbers for quotes or specific findings this way.

> The difference in the choice model logsum can be used as a measure of consumer surplus, and therefore accessibility improvement [@ben-akivaDiscreteChoiceAnalysis1985, p. 301]. -->
