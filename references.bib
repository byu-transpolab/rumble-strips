	abstract = {Driver distraction and speeding are two contributors to crashes in construction and maintenance work zones. Rumble strips can be effective and have been used in some states to alert drivers to reduce speed in advance of some change in the driving situation, such as at intersections. Previous research has examined the potential of using temporary rumble strips in advance of work zones. The purpose of this research was to compare the attention-getting characteristics of several temporary rumble strips with permanent rumble strips. Two types of devices were tested and compared with permanent rumble strips: portable plastic rumble strips and adhesive rubberized polymer rumble strips. These devices were tested for their ability to generate steering wheel vibrations and in-vehicle and roadside sound. Analysis revealed that the portable plastic rumble strips were more effective on cars than on trucks for generating in-vehicle vibration and increasing the in-vehicle sound level. Further, they were generally better than the adhesive rumble strips in matching the characteristics of the tested permanent rumble strip. This was also true for the configurations that contained fewer than six portable plastic rumble strips. If the vibration and sound generated by the permanent rumble strips is considered the standard performance, various configurations of the portable plastic rumble strips can be implemented in short-term work zones and provide results similar to those of permanent rumble strips.},

	abstract = {This research was conducted to determine how best to incorporate portable rumble strips into traffic control plans for short-term work zones. One objective of the research was to provide guidance on how existing traffic control plans could be amended to include provisions for the evaluated devices. This research focused on rumble strips that were considered beneficial for any type of work zone where the duration is one day or less. The tests on the portable rumble strips were conducted on a closed roadway surrounding the Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas, and in a closed park-and-ride parking facility in Lawrence, Kansas. The rumble strips tested in this study were two different types of reusable temporary rumble strips made out of steel with a rubber bottom and four generations of plastic rumble strips. From this study the best solution for most short-term work zones would be the latest generation of plastic rumble strips tested. The earlier generations did not perform as well as the fourth generation especially at 60 mph (96.6 km/hr). The steel rumble strips also hold some promise; however, the structural integrity of the steel rumble strips is an issue that needs to be addressed.},

	abstract = {The Rumbler is a temporary rumble strip consisting of several plastic bumps that are six inches wide, four (to six) feet long, and between 0.15 and 0.25 inches high. They are affixed to the pavement with an adhesive. The Rumbler was installed on the northbound approach of a recently signalized intersection in rural Dodge County, WI. Vehicular speeds were measured both before and after the installation of the Rumbler to test the hypothesis that the warning would evoke an immediate driver response. In addition, noise and vibration levels interior to an automobile were recorded for both the Rumbler and a nearby conventional rumble strip. The Rumbler is much quieter than a conventional rumble strip. The Rumbler also produced considerably less vibrations in the test automobile. The quality of sound from the Rumbler is also distinctly different from a conventional rumble strip. However the Rumbler’s sound is qualitatively different and louder than road noise. The Rumbler did not elicit a large behavioral response from drivers. However, the Rumbler may have had the effect of reminding drivers of the need to be alert to the signal.},

The project involved a focus group and a psychological scaling experiment, where each subject was asked to evaluate a temporary rumble strip relative to a cut-in-pavement rumble strip. In addition, sound and vibration measurements were made from within a vehicle passing over the strips. The ATM rumble strips (0.25 inches thick) were deployed within an actual work zone in Washington County (WI), while the RTI strips (0.75 inches thick) were tested in a large parking lot. An ATM strip when traversed at 55 mph was about as effective a warning device as a cut-in-pavement rumble strip. This same strip configuration when traversed at 40 mph was ineffective. The RTI product is an effective warning device for vehicle speeds between 10 and 40 mph.},

	abstract = {A field study was conducted on a Missouri low-volume road to examine if temporary rumble strips could improve safety in elevated-risk work zones. This study complements previous studies by addressing several new issues: vehicles that cross over a lane to bypass strips, physical displacement of strips, and deployment of strips at an angle. An objective was to measure performance in a challenging and nonidealized site, thus the site contained geometric challenges such as curves, a bridge approach, and a pavement transition. The study found an increase of more than 10\% in the number of vehicles that braked due to rumble strips, an average speed decrease of up to 6 kilometers per hour (3.7 miles per hour), and an increase in speed compliance of 2.9\% for the braking vehicles. But the number of lane crossovers increased by 8.79\%. The study also compared rumble strips deployed perpendicularly and at an angle and found no significant differences in braking and speed reductions but found an increase in lane crossovers. In terms of vertical movement, perpendicular strips did not move whereas angled strips moved up to 3.73 cm per 100 wheel impacts. Taking into account all study measures, the rumble strips provided a net improvement in safety.},

This paper uses controlled experiments in a driving simulator to investigate the effects of physical and digital temporary traffic control countermeasures on work zone safety. These include variable message signs, dynamic speed displays, rumble strips, and lane widths. 116 participants were recruited for the experiment. A linear mixed-effects model was developed to capture the effects of these countermeasures on average travel speed and standard deviation of speeds in the advanced warning area and within the work zone itself. The results reveal that rumble strips installed within the work zone cause the strongest reduction in speeds. Narrower lanes cause smaller speed reductions. In general, the effects of temporary traffic control countermeasures on speeds were local and were not retained beyond their proximity.},

The objective of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of temporary rumble strips used by MoDOT and other state Departments of Transportation (DOTs). The research methodology to meet this objective includes a review of existing literature, synthesis of MoDOT and other DOT practices, field observations of driver behavior and installation of temporary rumble strips, collection and analysis of speed data, and economic analysis. A synthesis of existing DOT practices found differences in levels of implementation and standards for temporary rumble strips among DOTs. Field observations of driver behavior noted rare instances of erratic driver behavior. Overall, the study found that temporary rumble strips can be an effective tool to lower vehicle speeds and reduce crashes and can lead to high benefit-cost ratios. Modifications to existing MoDOT practices may potentially reduce cost, increase installation efficiency, enhance worker safety, and improve performance of temporary rumble strips.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop specifications for portable reusable temporary rumble strips for their applications in different work zone settings in Kansas. A detailed literature review, a survey of practice, and a closed-course test were performed regarding temporary rumble strips. Additionally, data from permanent cut-in-place (CIP) rumble strips at six locations in Kansas were collected. All commercially available portable reusable temporary rumble strips were tested at once in a closed-course setting using a standard dump truck and a full-size car. The rumble strips' rotational movement, linear movement, and sound produced by a traversing vehicle were chosen as parameters in developing the decision matrix. Measurements of the strips’ linear and angular movements and sound generated due to the test vehicles passing over the rumble strips were collected for a total of 40 passes each at speeds of 22.5, 37.5, 57.5, and 67.5 mph. A matrix and a classification table were created with class intervals defining the classes based on the performance of temporary rumble strips at each of the speeds. Threshold limits for movements, rotation, and sound generation of the temporary rumble strips at each of the speeds were calculated for developing the classification table. Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and Average Daily Truck Traffic (ADTT) were used in calculating threshold limits for movement and rotation, and sound threshold limits were based on CIP strips' sound data. A matrix consisting of all the classes, which incorporates various work zone conditions ranging from low-speed, low-volume to high-speed, high-volume work zone conditions was developed. This matrix in combination with the classification table provides a basis for a recommended method of any vendor or a research team with information regarding the performance of a temporary rumble strip, the type of class it belongs to, and its applicability in various work zone conditions.},
